    "## Introduction\n",
    "As the company is seeking to diversify its portfolio through expansion into commercial and private aviation, it is impotrant to have a deep understanding of operational risks. Using the accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board, this project evaluates the safety records of various aircraft manufacturesrs and models from 1962 to 2023. I will explore the data to determine the lowest risk options available. This will inform actionable recommendations to stakeholders to acquire safe and reliable fleet."

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "1. Problem Statement\n",
    "The primary challenge is that the company lacks internal expertise regarding the safety profiles and potential risks associated with different types of aircraft. Investing in high-risk aircraft could lead to financial loss, legal liability, reputational damage, and loss of life. The company needs to know which aircraft present the lowest risk to ensure the safety of operations and the viability of the new business unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Main Objective\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to determine which aircraft manufacturers and models have the lowest risk profile to support the company's new business endeavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing historical aviation accident data to identify trends in safety.\n",
    "- Evaluating risk based on key factors such as aircraft make, engine type, and phase of flight.\n",
    "- Providing three concrete, actionable recommendations to the head of the new aviation division to guide their purchasing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stakeholders\n",
    "Primary Stakeholder: Head of the new Aviation Division.\n",
    "Secondary Stakeholders: Executive Board, Investors, and potential future passengers/clients who rely on the company's commitment to safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Source\n",
    "The analysis utilizes the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Aviation Accident Dataset, which contains information on civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States and international waters from 1962 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset allows for a robust assessment of long-term safety trends and specific incident causes."
